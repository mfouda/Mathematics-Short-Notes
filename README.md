# Mathematics Short Notes

This repository contains a collection of short personal notes on
may Mathematics subjects, such as Real Analysis, Measure Theory
and more.

It's main goal is to help me remind the main results in
each of these subjects. Thus, these notes serve as "cheat sheets",
where one can quickly go through most of a subject.

Here is a summary of what is in this repository (note that this
is not static, and I'll update as I write more stuff):
